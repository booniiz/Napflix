2.How to run this on Tomcat?

  Preconditions:
  
    - You need to populate the database first.
    - Run the stored-procedure(IN THE NAPFLIX DIRECOTRY)
    - Encrypt passwords for both users and employees
    - You provide(hard code) your database URI, username, password into databaseAuthentication class.
    - Your Tomcat server is clean(fresh out of the zips with no other webapps)
    
  Steps:
  
    1. cd under the Napflix director where the pom.xml lies
    2. mvn package
    3. cp ./target/*.war /your-tomcat-directory/webapps
    4. bash /your-tomcat-directory/bin/catalina.sh run(or start)
    5. your-public-addres:your port/Napflix(or what ever application context you decided to use)

4.Two parsing time optimization strategies compared with the naive approach.
 
    -Naive took(Just Insert): 1390934 = 1390 Seconds
    -INDEX On Genre(Name) and Stars(Name) (SET UP BEFORE Running parser): TOOK 561719 = 561 Seconds
    -Index On Genre(Name) and Stars(Name) (Place after insertion of the respective table) + Batch Processing when possible: 447488 = 447 Seconds

6.Inconsistent data report from parsing, it also can be referred from another separate report file generated by your code
